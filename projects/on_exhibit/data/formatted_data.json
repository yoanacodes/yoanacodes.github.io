patent model was submitted to the U.S. Patent Office by Francis D. Lee, an architect in Charleston, South Carolina, to illustrate his idea for a shipboard water tank that would float free of a sinking ship if drained in time. Passengers would cling to its exterior while a “treasure safe” suspended below the tank would save “bullion, mails, and other valuables.” If the tank itself sank, a smaller cork buoy would float out of the turret at the top to “mark the location of the lost treasure.” Lee’s first design of this invention was patented in 1857. This is the model for his revised version, also awarded a patent, in 1858.","The model is made of brass and measures 5” square and 6” high. A collar faced in wood separates the buoy’s square upper portion from its pyramidal lower section. Aboard ship, the square portion would sit exposed on the open deck, while the inverted pyramid would extend below. A strongbox, now missing from the model, would attach to the very tip of the pyramid. In an emergency, crew would stand on the wood-faced collar and hold fast to the rope lifelines. One man would turn a handle on the buoy’s side to open the hatches in the faces of the pyramid and drain the interior of its store of water. A small amount of water would remain in the bottom of the tank to act as ballast. If all went well, the buoy and its passengers would float away from the foundering ship.","In the 19th century, the U.S. Patent Office granted hundreds of patents for a wide variety of lifepreserving boats, rafts, clothing, and other gear. The surge in interest in lifesaving at sea was triggered by an increase in the number of passengers crossing the world’s oceans and by the expanded distribution of print media, which brought shipwreck details into more family parlors than ever before."],"isSensitive":false,"dateClean":1850},{"id":"edanmdm-saam_1994.17","title":"The Death of Cleopatra","unitCode":"SAAM","record_link":"https://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=33878","museum":"Smithsonian American Art Museum","media":["edanmdm-saam_1994.17-0"],"date":{"label":1870,"era":"AD","source":"1870s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Women","Reptile","Ethnicity","Animals","Figure female","State of being","Portraits","Death","Suicide","History","Snakes"],"geoLocation":false,"description":false,"dateClean":1870},{"id":"edanmdm-npg_NPG.67.31","title":"Noah Webster","unitCode":"NPG","record_link":"https://npg.si.edu/object/npg_NPG.67.31","museum":"National Portrait Gallery","media":["edanmdm-npg_NPG.67.31-0"],"date":{"label":1830,"era":"AD","source":"1830s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Legislators","Soldiers","Literature","Writers","Government","Quill","Portraits","Lawyers","Drafting & Writing Implements","Educators","Founder","Law and Law Enforcement","Education","Editors","Men","Textbook","American Revolution (1775-1783)","Politics","Lexicographer","Pens","Military"],"geoLocation":[{"L1":{"type":"Continent","content":"North America"},"L2":{"type":"Country","content":"United States"}},{"L1":{"type":"Continent","content":"North America"},"L2":{"type":"Country","content":"United States"},"L3":{"type":"State","content":"Massachusetts"}}],"description":false,"dateClean":1830},{"id":"edanmdm-npg_NPG.2019.5","title":"Peggy Bacon","unitCode":"NPG","record_link":"https://npg.si.edu/object/npg_NPG.2019.5","museum":"National Portrait Gallery","media":["edanmdm-npg_NPG.2019.5-0"],"date":{"label":1920,"era":"AD","source":"1920s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Art","Turban","Writers","Jewelry","Home Furnishings","Design","Chairs","Education","Seating","Tables","Drape","Women","Necklace","Literature","Painters","Interior decoration","Printmakers","Portraits","Educators","Furnishings","Headgear","Etcher","Illustrator","Costume","Caricaturist","Artists"],"geoLocation":false,"description":false,"dateClean":1920},{"id":"edanmdm-nmafa_2005-6-36","title":"Salt cellar","unitCode":"NMAfA","record_link":"https://africa.si.edu/collections/view/objects/asitem/items$0040:16983","museum":"National Museum of African Art","media":["edanmdm-nmafa_2005-6-36-0"],"date":{"label":1500,"era":"AD","source":"1500s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Status","Foreigner","Trade","Household","Men","Angels","Benin kingdom, Bini-Portuguese style"],"geoLocation":[{"L2":{"type":"Country","content":"Nigeria"}}],"description":["Ivory, circular salt cellar without a lid.

19th-century inventors turned their attention to life boats, a large number of them focusing their efforts on simplicity of construction, ease of launching, and imperviousness to sinking. By contrast, two Bavarian immigrants living in New York City—George Tremberger, carpenter, and Michael Stein, patterns machinist—focused on the “comfort, convenience, and safety of the passengers.” Their main innovation was to design the boat as a cylinder in which the cabin rolled independently from the overall motion of the boat. A geared wheel inside allowed the crew to adjust the cabin’s tilt by hand or to lock it in place. The inventors also fitted a telescoping mast, hand-lever-operated propeller, and external rubber bumpers for increased buoyancy.","This is a cutaway model of Tremberger and Stein’s idea. It shows seats and benches running lengthwise in the interior of the cabin. A wheel inside turns a gear that keeps the inner cabin from rolling as the outer hull rolls in the sea. Four hatches on deck slide open for access. The telescoping mast with sail can be operated from inside, while two interior levers activate the propeller.

It was submitted to the U.S. Patent Office in 1874 by George Clark, of Ecorse, Michigan, to accompany his design for an improved life raft.","A contemporary compiler of accidents noted 1,167 marine accidents on the Great Lakes for the year 1871 alone. “Of this number, 225 were caused by collisions,” he clarified, “280 vessels went ashore, 81 were burned, 26 capsized, 19 foundered, 182 sprung a leak, 65 waterlogged, 60 were dismasted, 110 lost deck-loads, and 10 exploded their boilers.” In the context of these harsh statistics, some inventors looked for ways to prevent accidents, while others sought ways to preserve life after the accident had occurred. George Clark was aiming for the second goal with this raft. He wrote, “The nature of this invention . . . has for its object the preservation of life in case of disaster at sea, by making the raft very buoyant, thoroughly protecting the float-cylinders, so they will not be injured under any ordinary circumstances, and furnishing a much more durable, a lighter, and more easily handled raft than those heretofore in use for this purpose.”","Clark envisioned these rafts carried on the hurricane decks of steamers, where they would be easily accessible in a disaster. The materials and construction made for a fairly lightweight raft, which could be thrown into the water “by one or two persons of ordinary strength, thus avoiding the delay and uncertainty of working falls and cranes in launching boats.” Because both sides of the raft were the same, it didn’t matter how it was tossed into the water. Clark acknowledged that cylindrical floats were already in use for other life rafts, but they tended to be much longer, extending the raft’s entire length or breadth. Under heavy conditions at sea, these long floats could have worked loose and destroyed the raft. Clark claimed that his use of shorter cylinders, arranged in courses and enclosed by the wooden decks, were less likely to cause such an accident, while providing the raft with greater flexibility."],"isSensitive":false,"dateClean":1870},{"id":"edanmdm-nmah_843790","title":"Patent Model, Life Boat","unitCode":"NMAH","record_link":false,"museum":"National Museum of American History","media":["edanmdm-nmah_843790-0"],"date":{"label":1840,"era":"AD","source":"1840s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Engineering","Architecture","Transportation","On the Water exhibit"],"geoLocation":[{"Other":{"type":"Place","content":"United States"}},{"Other":{"type":"Place","content":"New York"}},{"Other":{"type":"Place","content":"New York City"}},{"points":{"point":{"latitude":{"type":"decimal","content":"40.7"},"longitude":{"type":"decimal","content":"-74"}}}}],"description":["Joseph Francis of New York (1801–93) made a name for himself in the 1840s and 1850s manufacturing light and sturdy corrugated-iron lifeboats and other nautical gear. This 1841 patent model shows his design for a wood or metal boat fitted with airtight copper tanks. These tanks were to be charged with gas or air to provide buoyancy and, in an emergency, would work in conjunction with several holes through the bottom of the boat. When the boat started taking on water in rough seas, the holes would be opened. That action, combined with the buoyancy of the tanks, would permit drainage.","The well-known inventors of mid-19th-century America—Elias Howe, Cyrus McCormick, and Samuel F. B. Morse—were celebrated as national benefactors. Aspiring inventors regarded applying for a patent not just as a key step on the road to potential wealth, but as a patriotic duty—a contribution to the country’s betterment and future. Solidly within this style, Joseph Francis confidently called his buoyant boat the “great American life boat.” He declared with pride that “the model and application of the buoyant power which I now claim . . . is the best and safest for life boats and all other boats and vessels . . . it is different from and an improvement on all former invention by me and any other person . . . .”","In fact, the 1841 patent represented by this model is but a minor alteration to his first patent, an 1839 design for a double-bottomed boat fitted with buoyant air cylinders. His second attempt simply added additional tanks to the boat’s ends and flattened the bottom of the hull to enable it “to sit upright when left by a retiring surge upon a rock bar or beach, where other modeled boats would be upset.”"],"isSensitive":false,"dateClean":1840},{"id":"edanmdm-nasm_A19950010000","title":"Garmin GPS 155, Prototype","unitCode":"NASM","record_link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv99b5eb5cf-4d5b-4cec-8656-38ac40942b67","museum":"National Air and Space Museum","media":["edanmdm-nasm_A19950010000-0"],"date":{"label":1990,"era":"AD","source":"1990s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Avionics"],"geoLocation":[{"L2":{"type":"Country","content":"United States of America"}}],"description":false,"dateClean":1990},{"id":"edanmdm-nasm_A19520099000","title":"Receiver, Westport, Winnie Mae, Mod AP620","unitCode":"NASM","record_link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9d018d764-b4db-402e-821c-d90ab3e9aed5","museum":"National Air and Space Museum","media":["edanmdm-nasm_A19520099000-0"],"date":{"label":1910,"era":"AD","source":"1910s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Avionics"],"geoLocation":[{"L2":{"type":"Country","content":"United States of America"}}],"description":false,"dateClean":1910},{"id":"edanmdm-nmafa_85-19-20","title":"Plaque","unitCode":"NMAfA","record_link":"https://africa.si.edu/collections/view/objects/asitem/items$0040:8953","museum":"National Museum of African Art","media":["edanmdm-nmafa_85-19-20-0"],"date":{"label":1530,"era":"AD","source":"1530s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Status","Benin kingdom court style","Weapons","Men","Floral"],"geoLocation":[{"L2":{"type":"Country","content":"Nigeria"}}],"description":["Cast copper alloy plaque with a standing male figure with an eben, a leaf blade ceremonial sword, in his upraised proper right hand.

known for developing corrugated-iron lifesaving boats. This 1841 patent model reveals his ideas about a new method for constructing boats made of wood.","Trade and communication in 1840s America relied heavily on waterborne transportation, and boat building was an important related industry. With this invention, Joseph Francis sought to reduce the cost of constructing boats by simplifying the process. He proposed setting up a reusable frame over which very narrow planks would be bent to form the hull. The planks would be fastened together by bolts or nails driven through their edges, and no complicated joinery was to be done where the curves of the hull converged at bow and stern. “Ordinary workmen and machinery” could build this simple boat, he wrote. It would save on material, as none of the planks would overlap, and it would not require caulking, “as the narrow planking is drawn so closely together by the . . . nails . . . .” Finally, Francis claimed that the boat’s metal fasteners, buried between the planks, would not be likely to corrode and loosen the structure. Francis may have used this technique in his own boat works, but it was otherwise ignored by the nation’s many skilled boat builders."],"isSensitive":false,"dateClean":1840},{"id":"edanmdm-nmah_844264","title":"Patent Model, Life Boat","unitCode":"NMAH","record_link":false,"museum":"National Museum of American History","media":["edanmdm-nmah_844264-0","edanmdm-nmah_844264-1"],"date":{"label":1850,"era":"AD","source":"1850s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Transportation","On the Water exhibit"],"geoLocation":[{"Other":{"type":"Place","content":"United States"}},{"Other":{"type":"Place","content":"New York"}},{"Other":{"type":"Place","content":"New York City"}},{"Other":{"type":"Place","content":"Atlantic Ocean"}},{"points":{"point":{"latitude":{"type":"decimal","content":"40.7"},"longitude":{"type":"decimal","content":"-74"}}}},{"points":{"point":{"latitude":{"type":"decimal","content":"10"},"longitude":{"type":"decimal","content":"-25"}}}}],"description":["In 1845, Joseph Francis patented the use of stamped corrugated metal to make boats. Through collaboration with the Novelty Iron Works in New York, he began to manufacture lifeboats, military cutters, and coastal rescue craft, along with other marine safety gear. His sturdy products proved popular, and he sold many to commercial steamship operators, life-saving stations, and the United States Navy. By 1853, strong sales warranted the construction of a dedicated factory at Green Point, New York, where each hydraulic press could turn out parts for 40 boats a day. Francis continually experimented with new designs for his stamping process, and this patent model reflects changes to the shape of his boats’ corrugations that he developed in the late 1850s.","Joseph Francis (1801-93) is best known today for designing an enclosed rescue craft called a life-car, which was extensively used in coastal life-saving stations in the second half of the 19th century. The first life-car he made was used to spectacular effect in the rescue of all but one of the passengers and crew of the immigrant vessel <I>Ayrshire</I>, which ran aground on the New Jersey shore in a storm in January 1850. The Smithsonian preserves that life-car in addition to numerous models and ephemera documenting Joseph Francis’s work."],"isSensitive":false,"dateClean":1850},{"id":"edanmdm-nmafa_85-19-16","title":"Commemorative head of a king","unitCode":"NMAfA","record_link":"https://africa.si.edu/collections/view/objects/asitem/items$0040:8944","museum":"National Museum of African Art","media":["edanmdm-nmafa_85-19-16-0"],"date":{"label":1700,"era":"AD","source":"1700s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Status","Benin kingdom court style","Commemorative","Ancestral","Shrine/Altar","Men"],"geoLocation":[{"L2":{"type":"Country","content":"Nigeria"}}],"description":["Cast copper alloy cylindrical head with a beaded neck to the lower lip of the mouth, netted bead cap with clusters of beads on the sides, cylindrical beads in front, strands of beads in front of theears, braids behind the ears and a single large bead on the forehead.

They sewed the bags, repaired and restrung them as needed at the rate of 3 1/2 cents per bag. They were expected to finish 38 bags each day.

Santa Cruz, California.

The combined reaper and mower had a single large wheel with a driver’s seat to steer the horses and manipulate the mower, reaper, or rake attachments This harvester model was manufactured under the brand name “Champion.” The Champion was sold by a variety of company’s across the country from its home in Springfield, Ohio which is still known as the “Champion City.”","A reaper is a machine for harvesting grain crops, especially wheat. Drawn by horses (or a tractor), a reaper uses a large blade to cut wheat stalks. Early reapers required farmers to rake wheat off the machine by hand. On self-raking models, automatic rakes pushed the wheat across a platform and deposited it on the ground in bunches. Workers followed the reaper, gathering and tying bundles of wheat, called “sheaves.” They stacked the sheaves into piles, called “stooks,” for protection from wind and rain. Later, workers threshed and winnowed the wheat to remove edible grains from the inedible chaff."],"isSensitive":false,"dateClean":1870},{"id":"edanmdm-npg_NPG.93.476","title":"Henry Clay","unitCode":"NPG","record_link":"https://npg.si.edu/object/npg_NPG.93.476","museum":"National Portrait Gallery","media":["edanmdm-npg_NPG.93.476-0"],"date":{"label":1840,"era":"AD","source":"1840s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Legislators","Congressmen","Government","Cabinet Member","Portraits","Lawyers","Secretary of State","Speaker of the House","Law and Law Enforcement","Men","Senators","Politics","Presidential Candidate"],"geoLocation":[{"L1":{"type":"Continent","content":"North America"},"L2":{"type":"Country","content":"United States"}},{"L1":{"type":"Continent","content":"North America"},"L2":{"type":"Country","content":"United States"},"L3":{"type":"State","content":"Kentucky"}},{"L1":{"type":"Continent","content":"North America"},"L2":{"type":"Country","content":"United States"}},{"L1":{"type":"Continent","content":"North America"},"L2":{"type":"Country","content":"United States"}}],"description":false,"dateClean":1840},{"id":"edanmdm-npg_NPG.96.47","title":"Mr. Hackett, in the Character of Rip Van Winkle","unitCode":"NPG","record_link":"https://npg.si.edu/object/npg_NPG.96.47","museum":"National Portrait Gallery","media":["edanmdm-npg_NPG.96.47-0"],"date":{"label":1820,"era":"AD","source":"1820s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Nature","Literature","Writers","Owl","Birds","Portraits","Ecology","Firearms","Theater Manager","Theater","Landscapes","Animals","Weapons","Actors and actresses","Men","Entertainers","Rifle"],"geoLocation":[{"L1":{"type":"Continent","content":"North America"},"L2":{"type":"Nation","content":"United States"},"L3":{"type":"State","content":"New York"},"L4":{"type":"County","content":"Kings"},"L5":{"type":"City","content":"New York"}}],"description":false,"dateClean":1820},{"id":"edanmdm-npg_NPG.82.136","title":"Edith Wharton","unitCode":"NPG","record_link":"https://npg.si.edu/object/npg_NPG.82.136","museum":"National Portrait Gallery","media":["edanmdm-npg_NPG.82.136-0"],"date":{"label":1870,"era":"AD","source":"1870s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Nature","Women","Literature","Writers","Legion of Honor","Portraits","Ecology","Plants","Flowers","Humanities and Social Sciences","Pulitzer Prize","Historians","Novelists"],"geoLocation":false,"description":false,"dateClean":1870},{"id":"edanmdm-npg_NPG.67.53","title":"Henry George","unitCode":"NPG","record_link":"https://npg.si.edu/object/npg_NPG.67.53","museum":"National Portrait Gallery","media":["edanmdm-npg_NPG.67.53-0"],"date":{"label":1880,"era":"AD","source":"1880s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Business and Finance","Writers","Mustaches","Printer","Reformers","Politician","Crafts and Trades","Education","Journalism","Economics","Literature","Society and social change","Government","Reporter","Communications","Portraits","Facial Hair","Social Reformer","Lecturer","Educators","Magazine article","Editors","Men","Newspapers","Politics","Crafts","Beards"],"geoLocation":false,"description":false,"dateClean":1880},{"id":"edanmdm-npg_NPG.76.37","title":"Lillian D.

Beginning with his appearance in the fall of 1888 at the Albany, New York, Post Office, he accompanied mail pouches being forwarded by rail throughout the United States and the world.","When his railway excursions started, the Albany mail clerks began the tradition of the \"Owney tag\" by fastening a note to his collar asking employees of the Railway Mail Service to record his journeys by attaching leather and metal baggage tags. As this became popular, Postmaster General John Wanamaker presented the dog with a special harness-like jacket on which to distribute the tags. In addition to 1889 Exposition Universelle tag shown here, Owney was presented with more than one thousand baggage claim tags, hotel key checks, tokens, badges, medals, coins, buttons and other trinkets. The back of this tag is marked \"Republique Francaise / N.J. Schloss & Co.\"","Owney's travels, recorded by these tags and legend, took him to Canada, Mexico and Alaska. And in 1895 he traveled from Tacoma, Washington to Japan, China, Singapore, Suez, Algiers and the Azores via the steamships \"Victoria\" and \"Port Phillip\" before returning to New York City and then by rail to Tacoma. He was sent by registered mail during part of this round-the-world journey, labeled as \"Registered Dog Package\".","Between 1893 and 1897, Owney was presented with many special awards and medals by kennel clubs and dog shows in recognition of his nationwide celebrity.","This is one of three tags that had been fastened together on Owney's jacket.

The peace treaty negotiated at Paris in 1763 resulted in France's loss of all her possessions in continental North America; Spain traded Florida for Havana, which had been conquered in the war's waning days. Britain stood as the unchallenged colonial power east of the Mississippi River.","The war had been expensive, and Prime Minister George Grenville called for the American colonists to shoulder some of the costs. His administration introduced a series of indirect taxes -- customs duties paid by importers and passed on to the consumer as a markup. In 1765, however, Parliament passed An Act for Granting and Applying Certain Stamp Duties in the British Colonies and Plantations in America, commonly called \"The Stamp Act.\" It prescribed a direct tax of one penny per sheet on newspapers and required that the newspapers be printed on stamped paper purchased from government agents. In addition to the tax, these provisions raised the specter of censorship; if a newspaper proved troublesome to the authorities, its supply of paper could be cut off. The Stamp Act took effect on November 1, 1765.","The Board of Stamps prepared two hundred copper dies and eight plates of the one-penny stamps. The design consists of a mantle; St. Edward's Crown encircled by the Order of the Garter; and a scepter and sword. At top is the word AMERICA; at bottom the denomination ONE PENNY and the number of the individual die. Dark red proof impressions of the plates were made on thick laid paper before production of the stamped paper began.","News of the Stamp Act infuriated some American colonists, especially newspaper publishers. The Boston Gazette caricatured the proposed stamps with a skull and crossbones and the words, \"This is the place to affix the STAMP.\" The Pennsylvania Journal and Weekly Advertiser suspended publication with the October 31 edition rather than acquiesce to using the stamp; it appeared with a black mourning border and announced that it was \"EXPIRING: In Hopes of a Resurrection to LIFE again.\" Mounting cries of taxation without representation and public violence against the stamp agents eventually led Parliament to repeal the act on March 18, 1766. The only newspaper in continental North America known to have used the stamp was the Halifax, (Nova Scotia) Gazette. It was never used in any of the colonies that later became part of the United States.","Only thirty-two copies of the original dark-red proof impressions made in 1765 have survived. Twenty-six of these are contained in a partial proof sheet owned by the British Library Philatelic Collections. Five more -- three singles and a pair -- are in private hands, and the one pictured here is in the Smithsonian National Postal Museum's permanent collection. John A. Brill of Philadelphia donated it to the National Philatelic Collection on May 25, 1889. According to the donor, the stamp was from the estate of \"of the Hon. Welbore Ellis, Commissioner of the Internal Revenue for Great Britain,\" by whom he likely meant Welbore Ellis Agar, an art collector and a commissioner of His Majesty's Customs (1776 -1805).","All other known copies are lithographed reproductions made for the Centennial International Exhibition held at Philadelphia in 1876. Although these were apparently made for display at the exhibition, some copies reached the philatelic marketplace through John Walter Scott, an early stamp dealer from New York City.","Reference:","Koeppel, Adolph.

It has a buff wool rise-and-fall collar, buff cuffs and lapels, and buff lining; there is a row of yellow metal buttons on each lapel, as well as on each cuff.","The waistcoat and breeches are matching buff wool, with gilt buttons.","Specific History","This uniform consisting of coat, waistcoat, and knee breeches was initially donated to the Columbian Institute; in 1841, it was transferred to the National Institute and housed in the Patent Office. It came to the Smithsonian in 1883 from the Patent Office collection, and has been on display almost continuously. (From the years 1942 to 1944, during World War II, the Smithsonian packed up many of its treasured artifacts, including this uniform, and sent them to the Shenandoah Valley for safekeeping.)","This uniform was worn by George Washington from 1789 until his death in 1799; the small clothes, or breeches and waistcoat, date from the revolutionary period.","Washington often posed for life portraits during this period, and was often depicted wearing this uniform. An example is the watercolor portrait on ivory painted by John Ramage in 1789; it is the first known depiction of this uniform in a portrait of Washington.","In December 1798, Washington was recorded wearing this uniform when he visited Philadelphia on Provisional Army duty. He wore a similar uniform when he was commissioned by the Continental Congress as commander in chief of the Continental army.","None of his uniforms from the Revolutionary War period are known to have survived.","General History","When George Washington was an aide to General Edward Braddock he paid special attention to the way the British general maintained his rank and deportment. Washington believed that in order to command effectively, an officer must convey character and leadership through appearance as well as action. As the leader of the Continental army, Washington wanted these troops to present themselves as a professional military organization and a proper uniform was one way of showing a unified front. In commemoration of Washington’s attention to detail, the colors of blue and buff remained the accepted pattern for U.S. Army uniforms until the beginning of the Civil War."],"isSensitive":false,"dateClean":1780},{"id":"edanmdm-nmah_660950","title":"James S.

Rankin from Muscoda, Minnesota, received a U.S. patent for an improved school desk. Patent no. 211521 was issued on January 21, 1879.","This model has four seats with a slat of wood for a backrest and sits on a wooden base. The seats connect to each other, side by side, by a piece of wood that also connects to the desk, so two chairs share one desk. This desk model was considered an improvement in school desks because it was a double desk that would separate students like a single desk. The backs are elastic and adjustable. The backrest is made to fit under the shoulder blades and designed so that no hard points or surfaces are touching the spine. This would make the chair more comfortable to sit in. The chair was meant to support the students so they might have an \"erect and natural position.\" It was considered easy to access and allowed easy sweeping of the floors.","James S. Rankin was born in 1818. He served as a county and city superintendent of schools in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He was known for the Rankin School Desk, which was popular because it was inexpensive and convenient. These desks were used in Louisville, Kentucky; Chicago, Illinois, and many other city schools. His desk was exhibited in the Mechanic’s Hall at the Indiana State Fair where it was recommended for first premium, a cash award.

It is a simple registration mail handstamp that was used to mark the date a mail piece was received and processed. What makes this ordinary piece striking are the date on the stamp--“Dec. 6 1941”--and where it was used--aboard the USS Oklahoma. The handstamp was recovered from the Oklahoma after it sank during the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.","The U.S. Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor, a major U.S. naval base located on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, was attacked early in the morning of December 7, 1941, by a combined force of Japanese submarines and airplanes. The Imperial Japanese Navy launched two attacks. At 6 a.m. that morning, 183 warplanes left the decks of six Imperial Japanese aircraft carriers, headed for Hawaii. An hour later, a second group of 171 fighters, bombers, and torpedo airplanes followed.","The attack lasted only a few hours, but the U.S. losses were staggering. Eight U.S. battleships and ten other naval vessels were sunk or severely damaged during the attack in which 2,107 U.S. naval and military personnel were killed. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared that December 7 would \"live in infamy.\" It marked the entrance of the United States into World War II. Congress declared war against Japan on December 8, 1941.","The USS Oklahoma was one of eight battleships at 'Battleship Row' that morning.","Struck during the first phase of the attack, the ship was first hit by three torpedoes and immediately thereafter by two more. The ship heeled to port. Only minutes after being hit, it slowly rolled over until the mast jammed in the mud, leaving the ship upside down. One third of the ship's crew was killed, and 935 sailors survived. Thirty-two men, trapped inside the ship for three days, guided a rescue team to their location by tapping on the hull. The ship was eventually righted, and on September 1, 1944, it was decommissioned. Two years later, after having been sold for scrap, the Oklahoma sank in heavy seas while being towed to the mainland.","Because the attack on Pearl Harbor came early on Sunday morning, the registration handstamp still carried the previous day's date, Dec. 6, 1941."],"isSensitive":false,"dateClean":1930},{"id":"edanmdm-nmaahc_2015.249.4.2","title":"Wood 4 golf club used by Ethel Funches","unitCode":"NMAAHC","record_link":"https://nmaahc.si.edu/object/nmaahc_2015.249.4.2","museum":"National Museum of African American History and Culture","media":["edanmdm-nmaahc_2015.249.4.2-0","edanmdm-nmaahc_2015.249.4.2-1","edanmdm-nmaahc_2015.249.4.2-2"],"date":{"label":1950,"era":"AD","source":"1950s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Amusements","Sport","Golf","Athletes","Sports"],"geoLocation":false,"description":["A wood golf club from Wilson, used by Ethel Funches.","The shaft is silver in color and is made out of metal.

The excess of oxygen was provided by the lamp’s large draft passage, which was divided into compartments to prevent stiff currents of air from blowing out the flame.","Coal oil originally emitted a smoky flame until it was refined into kerosene. This refinement allowed lamps to be used indoors. The bright and economical flame changed concepts of time, work, leisure activities, and consumption.

Stamps"],"geoLocation":[{"Other":{"type":"Place","content":"United States of America"}}],"description":["Perhaps the most enigmatic of all American stamps, the Buffalo balloon stamp is certainly among the premier rarities in aerophilately. This stamp begs the question, “What is an airmail stamp?” Described variously as “experimental,” “semi-official,” “a carrying label,” and even as a vignette or cinderella, the fact remains that it was the first of its kind ever issued. Since it was privately issued for use with a standard U.S. postal service 3-cent stamp to pay for air handling of a mailed piece, it was (if one includes both private and government issues) the world’s first airmail stamp.","False information abounds about this stamp. Original reports confirm that Wheeler Brothers Printers and Publishers, Nashville, Tennessee, printed the stamp. The stamp is an accurate representation of the enormous 92,000 cubic foot “Buffalo” balloon of Professor Samuel Archer King (1828-1914), and was designed by John B. Lillard, a clerk in the Wheeler firm and a passenger on the great flight. Interestingly, the engraver of the stamp was John H. Snively, a scientist who provided apparatus for experiments on the flight. The stamps were printed tete-beche format—that is, they are shown right side up and upside down below on one sheet. It is likely that in printing the stamp, one side was printed, and then the sheet was taken out and turned round and fed back in the press to produce a mirror image of the first row. These tete-beche pairs are pretty uniformly approximately 35mm in width. The spacing between the mirror images varies from 6mm to as much as 9mm, the majority being about 7-7.5 mm.","An 1894 letter by Lillard states that three stamps were printed, and while he states further “23 used,” most scholars agree there were probably about two hundred carried, and twenty-three might refer to his private usage. The Buffalo balloon launched from Nashville, Tennessee, on June 18, 1877. A number of covers were dropped, probably in containing envelopes or drop bags sewn to brightly colored nine-foot streamers.","After the Gallatin, Tennessee, landing, there was a second flight the next morning. There were also other, later flights of the Buffalo, and covers could have been flown on any of those flights.","There are four varieties of the Buffalo stamp—a proof version, a standard issue, one with die flaws, and another with corrected die flaws. The stamp was issued as deep blue, but at least one black proof version exists. The stamp is known in singles, tete-beche pairs, and unreliably, it is reported that a block of four still exists. At this writing, there are two postally used covers known with the Buffalo stamp, although a third cover, almost certainly flown but uncancelled, also exists.","Reference:","Robert Schoendorf, The Buffalo Balloon Mail 1873-1877, privately printed, 1979.","Maureen & Chris Lynch","May 18, 2006"],"isSensitive":false,"dateClean":1870},{"id":"edanmdm-nmaahc_2012.62.1","title":"Golf driver signed by Tiger Woods","unitCode":"NMAAHC","record_link":"https://nmaahc.si.edu/object/nmaahc_2012.62.1","museum":"National Museum of African American History and Culture","media":["edanmdm-nmaahc_2012.62.1-0","edanmdm-nmaahc_2012.62.1-1","edanmdm-nmaahc_2012.62.1-2"],"date":{"label":2000,"era":"AD","source":"2000s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Amusements","Sport","Golf","Athletes","Sports"],"geoLocation":false,"description":["A right-handed NikeSasQuatch 460 driver signed by Tiger Woods.

Smith on September 17, 1878. His invention was an improved design for a windmill with folding sails. The concept of the folding sail windmill was not new. In fact Mr. Smith had received an earlier patent for such a windmill. Folding sails allowed the windmill to automatically regulate its speed in varying wind strengths. As the wind increased the individual arms and sails would progressively fold up to present less area to the wind, thus acting as a governor. Once completely folded the windmill had little more cross section to the wind than would a windmill with a single arm and two sails. In Smith’s first folding sail design the maximum angle between its eight sails was limited by leather straps interconnecting each sail arm. Speed was then controlled by an auxiliary sail attached to the sails on the inner most sail arm. This auxiliary sail was loosely held down onto its host sail by a spring. As the wheel speed became greater the spring was overcome and the auxiliary sail would open to an angle of 90 degrees to the plane of the primary sail. This caused the inner arm and sails to slow until it was behind the next outer arm and sails, and this was repeated for the rest of the arms and sails until the wheel was folded. At that point little more than two sails face the wind and the speed of the wheel would be at a minimum. Smith included a braking wheel on the hub of the inner most arm and sail set. A wooden lever was pivoted at the front of the cross-head and could be pulled down by a rope led to the base of the windmill, thus making the lever contact the brake wheel and stop the windmill. There were two new elements in Smith’s 1878 patent. The first was to replace the function of the leather straps that controlled arm and sail spacing with a new design for the hubs at the center of each arm. Each hub had metal projections on its circumference that limited the motion of the next arm to an angle of 30 degrees to it. The outer-most arm was secured in place with a set screw on the shaft. This allowed the six arms to be evenly spaced around the wheel when fully extended. Folding of the wheel in heavy wind was controlled as in the earlier patent. The second new element was a modification of the braking mechanism. The tail-board beam was pivoted at the rear of the cross-head. This allowed the front of the beam to move upward to contact the brake wheel, and the weight of the tail-board was sufficient to apply friction and stop the windmill. A rod attached to the front of the brake lever was led to the base of the windmill and could be drawn down and pinned to disable the brake for normal operation.","The patent model is constructed of wood and metal and is mounted on a wooden base. The model illustrates the main elements of the patent including the hubs controlling the spacing of the arms when extended and the braking mechanism. The model also includes a thread representing the rope extending to the base of the windmill tower used to engage the braking mechanism. Not represented on the model is the auxiliary sail used to fold the windmill to govern speed in high winds."],"isSensitive":false,"dateClean":1870},{"id":"edanmdm-saam_1985.66.388","title":"Fort Union, Mouth of the Yellowstone River, 2000 Miles above St. Louis","unitCode":"SAAM","record_link":"https://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=4063","museum":"Smithsonian American Art Museum","media":["edanmdm-saam_1985.66.388-0"],"date":{"label":1830,"era":"AD","source":"1830s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Western","Landscapes","Architecture","Domestic","Teepee","Fort","Rivers","Yellowstone River","Fort Union","Military"],"geoLocation":false,"description":false,"dateClean":1830},{"id":"edanmdm-saam_1985.66.505","title":"Bull Dance, Mandan O-kee-pa Ceremony","unitCode":"SAAM","record_link":"https://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=3975","museum":"Smithsonian American Art Museum","media":["edanmdm-saam_1985.66.505-0"],"date":{"label":1830,"era":"AD","source":"1830s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Western","Rites and ceremonies","Ethnicity","Architecture","O Kee Pa Ceremony","Men","Domestic","Figure group","Dance","Bull Dance","Dwellings"],"geoLocation":false,"description":false,"dateClean":1830},{"id":"edanmdm-saam_1985.66.399","title":"River Bluffs, 1320 Miles above St. Louis","unitCode":"SAAM","record_link":"https://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=4335","museum":"Smithsonian American Art Museum","media":["edanmdm-saam_1985.66.399-0"],"date":{"label":1830,"era":"AD","source":"1830s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Western","Landscapes","Ethnicity","Figure male","Rivers"],"geoLocation":false,"description":false,"dateClean":1830},{"id":"edanmdm-nmaahc_2019.28.36","title":"Contract for labor from Freedman Henry Dred, wife Sylvester, and child Alfred","unitCode":"NMAAHC","record_link":"https://nmaahc.si.edu/object/nmaahc_2019.28.36","museum":"National Museum of African American History and Culture","media":["edanmdm-nmaahc_2019.28.36-0","edanmdm-nmaahc_2019.28.36-1"],"date":{"label":1860,"era":"AD","source":"1860s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Slavery","American South","Labor unions","Family","Agriculture","Reconstruction, U.S. History, 1865-1877","Emancipation"],"geoLocation":[{"L4":{"type":"County","content":"Clarke County"}},{"L3":{"type":"State","content":"Alabama"}},{"L2":{"type":"Country","content":"United States"}},{"L1":{"type":"Continent","content":"North and Central America"}}],"description":["A handwritten contract between Freedman Dred and Mary Josephine Rivers.

After perforation, mail was fumigated with sulphur fumes before being returned to the mail stream.","Yellow fever, an infectious disease actually caused by a virus, can kill within a few days of onset. It is characterized by severe high fever, head and backaches, and jaundice, or yellowing of the skin which results from the destruction of liver cells, resulting in the accumulation of yellow bile pigments in the skin.","In the United States, mail was sometimes treated in attempts to halt the spread of a number of deadly diseases, including yellow fever, smallpox, plague, typhus, cholera, diphtheria, measles, leprosy, scarlet fever, tuberculosis, influenza, and even mumps. Health agencies viewed mail with suspicion, believing that somehow the letters and newspapers could carry a disease from infected areas into healthy ones.","To contain a yellow fever epidemic in Florida in 1888, the supervisory surgeon general asked that all outgoing people, baggage, and mail be subject to inspection. The postmaster general agreed to fumigate all mail leaving the state. Letters were perforated with paddles, newspapers loosened, and the mail scattered on wire netting shelves in a railway mail car. After placing sulfur in iron kettles in the car and igniting it, employees closed up the mail car doors to let the fumes do their work.","Yellow fever outbreaks were common in the nineteenth century, and it was not until 1881 that doctors first considered the theory that yellow fever was transmitted by mosquito bites. A Cuban doctor, Carlos Finlay, was the first to present this hypothesis, which was finally verified in 1901. Although there is still no known treatment for yellow fever, Dr. Max Theiler developed a vaccine for the disease in 1939.","Text and an illustration were added to the back of the paddle sometime after the Montgomery outbreak, when the fever’s true cause was known.

This arrangement limited the number of harnesses that could be utilized, which in turn limited the complexity of patterns that could be woven. In order to vary the pattern, the cams had to be laboriously changed. Crompton’s invention solved both of these problems. In his patent, an endless pattern chain was used, upon which rollers or pins could be variously placed to engage the harness levers (as had the cams) but which allowed any number of harnesses to be used and easily permitted the changing of patterns. Now more elaborate designs could be easily woven on power looms.","In 1806 William Crompton was born in the textile mill town of Preston, England. He was taught how to weave on a cotton hand loom and learned the trade of a machinist. He was thirty when he came to Taunton, Massachusetts, and was employed by Crocker and Richmond. At this textile mill he designed a loom to weave a new more complex patterned fabric. The mill failed in 1837 and Crompton went back to England. He entered into cotton manufacture with John Rostran, and took out a British patent for his loom under Rostran’s name.","Later in 1839 Crompton emigrated with his family back to the United States in order to promote his looms. He met with success when the Middlesex Mills in Lowell, Massachusetts, invited him to alter his fancy cotton loom for the weaving of woolen fabrics. This he accomplished in 1840, and it was considered an important landmark for the woolen industry. In his book, American Textile Machinery, John Hayes quotes the Committee on Patents of the United States House of Representatives, 1878: “ . . . upon the Crompton loom or looms based on it, are woven every yard of fancy cloth in the world.”","In 1849, William’s health declined and his son, George, carried on the business. Like his father, George was an inventor and patented many improvements for the loom. After 1859, the Crompton Loom Work became one of the two largest fancy loom manufacturers in the United States.","Patent No. 491 Issued November 25, 1837","William Crompton of Taunton, Massachusetts"],"isSensitive":false,"dateClean":1830},{"id":"edanmdm-nmah_848382","title":"Howe’s Patent Model of a Pin Making Machine - ca 1841","unitCode":"NMAH","record_link":false,"museum":"National Museum of American History","media":["edanmdm-nmah_848382-0","edanmdm-nmah_848382-1","edanmdm-nmah_848382-2"],"date":{"label":1840,"era":"AD","source":"1840s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Manufacturing industries","Patents","Engineering","Architecture","Models (representations)"],"geoLocation":[{"Other":{"type":"Place","content":"United States"}},{"Other":{"type":"Place","content":"Connecticut"}},{"Other":{"type":"Place","content":"Derby"}},{"points":{"point":{"latitude":{"type":"decimal","content":"41.8333"},"longitude":{"type":"decimal","content":"-72.8333"}}}},{"points":{"point":{"latitude":{"type":"decimal","content":"41.3167"},"longitude":{"type":"decimal","content":"-73.0833"}}}}],"description":["This model was filed with the application to the U.S. Patent Office for Patent Number 2,013 issued to John Ireland Howe on March 24, 1841.

Howe had been a physician working in the New York Alms House where he had observed the inmates making pins by hand. He began to experiment with machinery for automating the process and sought the help of Robert Hoe, a printing press builder, to provide mechanical expertise. His design was for a machine that would take a roll of wire, cut the wire for each pin to proper length, sharpen and polish the pointed end of the pin, and finally form the other end into a metal head. The machine consisted of a series of individual chucks (devices much like on lathes) mounted radially on a vertical shaft that rotated inside a horizontal circular frame. Around the circumference of the frame were mounted various tools that shaped the pins. As the vertical shaft rotated, it brought the chucks into alignment with the tools. One type of tool was the point forming file, or mill. The chuck, which was rotating along the axis of the pin, would make the pin tip contact the file thus grinding it into shape. The file was also rotating as well as moving forward, backwards, and side-to-side in a complex manner so as to produce a point which was round, smooth, free from angles, and slightly convex in shape. Howe made provisions for multiple such tools to progressively shape the point. The other major tool was the head forming mechanism. A carrier removed the pin from its chuck and inserted its blunt end into a set of gripping jaws that held it into a set of dies. The dies formed a thickened section of metal at the end of the pin. A second carrier extracted the pin and inserted the thickened section into a second set of dies which then flattened and formed the final pin head. The machines made from the patent design enabled the Howe Manufacturing Company become one of the largest pin manufacturers in the United States.","The patent model is constructed primarily of metal and is about one foot square and one foot tall. It represents the essential elements of the design such as the rotating set of chucks mounted on the vertical shaft, the sharpening mills, and the head making mechanisms. It shows how the rotating table brings the pins to the point sharpening mills. While it is uncertain that the model would be capable of actual pin production, it appears that turning the attached hand crank would cause the machine to go through the motions of actual pin production."],"isSensitive":false,"dateClean":1840},{"id":"edanmdm-nmaahc_2014.312.6","title":"Branding iron with \"S\" head","unitCode":"NMAAHC","record_link":"https://nmaahc.si.edu/object/nmaahc_2014.312.6","museum":"National Museum of African American History and Culture","media":["edanmdm-nmaahc_2014.312.6-0","edanmdm-nmaahc_2014.312.6-1","edanmdm-nmaahc_2014.312.6-2"],"date":{"label":1800,"era":"AD","source":"1800s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Slavery","Violence"],"geoLocation":[{"L3":{"type":"State","content":"Georgia"}},{"L2":{"type":"Country","content":"United States"}},{"Other":{"type":"Subregion","content":"Lowcountry"}},{"L1":{"type":"Continent","content":"North and Central America"}}],"description":["Slave branding iron with \"S\" head.

Beville, the inventor of the “Iron Duke” windmill, was a traveling salesman for a farm implement company in Indiana. He designed the windmill while on the road in the 1870s. A young Union veteran, Beville held a variety of jobs after returning from the war and, at one point, lost all of his possessions in a fire. After receiving his patent in 1880, Beville licensed the Iron Duke for manufacture and sale, making a substantial profit on his invention. That same year, he opened a real estate office in Indianapolis. Between windmill sales and real estate, Beville had a prosperous career. Well-respected in the business community and active in civic life, he helped attract a number of manufacturing companies to Indianapolis.","In early America, windmills followed the European model. As the wind changed direction, workers manually adjusted the position of large wood and cloth sails. In the 1850s, inventor Daniel Halladay and his business partner, John Burnham, introduced a self-regulating windmill and water pump. In contrast to traditional windmills, self-regulating windmills had a tail vane to turn blades. A centrifugal governor regulated speed by changing the angle of the blades. This allowed the windmill to work efficiently in low winds and slow down for protection in high winds. Windmills provided farmers and ranchers with a reliable power source to pump water from underground. Halladay and Burnham moved from New England to Chicago to take advantage of the expanding Midwestern market, and other manufacturers followed their lead. Between 1870 and 1900, American farmers put about 230 million acres into agricultural production, much of it in the arid Great Plains.","The Iron Duke, as its name suggests, was an all-iron windmill. Until the 1870s, American windmills were wooden, containing metal only in bolts and other small parts. In 1876, the first metal windmill, J. S. Risdon’s “Iron Turbine,” appeared on the market. Other models followed, but according to historian T. Lindsay Baker, major production of metal windmills did not begin for another twenty years. Beginning in the 1890s, manufacturers were able to take advantage of lower steel prices. The manufacturers of the Iron Duke compared its strength and durability to that of wooden windmills. An advertisement in The American Agriculturist announced, “Will not shrink, warp, split, decay, and will stand more work than any mill extant.” Yet, despite the growing popularity of iron or steel models, many farmers and ranchers preferred wood. They found metal windmills difficult to repair, and many manufacturers had a reputation for using less steel to cut costs."],"isSensitive":false,"dateClean":1880},{"id":"edanmdm-npg_NPG.65.83","title":"Signing of the Treaty of Versailles, 1919","unitCode":"NPG","record_link":"https://npg.si.edu/object/npg_NPG.65.83","museum":"National Portrait Gallery","media":["edanmdm-npg_NPG.65.83-0"],"date":{"label":1910,"era":"AD","source":"1910s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Artwork","Writers","Public Official","Headdresses","Ambassador","Windows","Secretary of State","Governors","Pulitzer Prize","Printed Material","Universities","Design","Sculpture","Education","Public officers","Diplomats","Joint Chiefs of Staff","Presidents","Military","Presidential Advisor","Congressional Gold Medal","Literature","World War, 1914-1918","Architecture","Government","Diplomacy","Interior decoration","Cabinet Member","Portraits","Lawyers","Educators","Headgear","Law and Law Enforcement","Nobel Prize","Costume","Men","Administrators","Politics","Officer"],"geoLocation":[{"L1":{"type":"Continent","content":"North America"},"L2":{"type":"Country","content":"United States"}},{"L1":{"type":"Continent","content":"North America"},"L2":{"type":"Country","content":"United States"},"L3":{"type":"State","content":"New Jersey"}}],"description":false,"dateClean":1910},{"id":"edanmdm-nmaahc_2013.157.1","title":"Wrist watch worn by Harriette Moore","unitCode":"NMAAHC","record_link":"https://nmaahc.si.edu/object/nmaahc_2013.157.1","museum":"National Museum of African American History and Culture","media":["edanmdm-nmaahc_2013.157.1-0"],"date":{"label":1920,"era":"AD","source":"1920s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Women","Education","Segregation","Violence","Clothing and dress","Family","Hate crimes","Civil rights"],"geoLocation":[{"L5":{"type":"City","content":"New Carrollton"}},{"L4":{"type":"County","content":"Prince George's County"}},{"L3":{"type":"State","content":"Maryland"}},{"L2":{"type":"Country","content":"United States"}},{"L1":{"type":"Continent","content":"North and Central America"}},{"L5":{"type":"City","content":"Mims"}},{"L4":{"type":"County","content":"Brevard County"}},{"L3":{"type":"State","content":"Florida"}},{"L2":{"type":"Country","content":"United States"}},{"L1":{"type":"Continent","content":"North and Central America"}}],"description":["Woman’s wrist watch worn by Harriette Vyda Sims Moore.

As a young man he worked as a mechanic and cabinetmaker. For a time he was an actor and formed his own theatrical troupe, The Merritt Players.” Needing a steadier income, Singer worked for a plant in Fredericksburg, Ohio, that manufactured wooden type for printers. Seeing the need for a better type-carving machine, he invented an improved one.","In June 1850, Singer and a partner took the machine to Boston looking for financial support. He rented display space in the workshop of Orson C. Phelps. Here Singer became intrigued with the sewing machine that Phelps was building for John A. Lerow and Sherburne C. Blodgett. Analyzing the flaws of the Lerow and Blodgett sewing machine, Singer devised a machine that used a shuttle that moved in a straight path—as opposed to theirs, which moved around in a complete circle. He visualized replacing their curved horizontal needle with a straight, vertically moving needle. Phelps approved of Singer’s ideas and Isaac worked on perfecting his machine.","For his first patent model, Isaac Singer submitted a commercial sewing machine. He was granted Patent No. 8,294, on August 12, 1851. These commercial sewing machines were built in Orson C. Phelps’s machine shop in Boston. The head, base cams, and gear wheels of the machine were made of cast iron; to fit together, these parts had to be filed and ground by hand. The machine made a lockstitch by using a straight, eye-pointed needle and a reciprocating shuttle. The specific patent claims allowed were for: 1) the additional forward motion of the shuttle to tighten the stitch; 2) the use of a friction pad to control the tension of the thread from the spool; and 3) placing the spool of thread on an adjustable arm to permit thread to be used as needed.","Always the showman, Singer relished exhibiting his invention at social gatherings and was masterful in convincing the women present that the sewing machine was a tool they could learn to use. The machine was transported in its packing crate, which served as a stand; it contained a wooden treadle that allowed the seamstress to power the machine with her feet, leaving both hands free to guide the cloth. This early, heavy-duty Singer machine was designed for use in the manufacturing trades rather than in the home."],"isSensitive":false,"dateClean":1850},{"id":"edanmdm-nmah_844281","title":"Patent Model for Steering Steam Ships","unitCode":"NMAH","record_link":false,"museum":"National Museum of American History","media":["edanmdm-nmah_844281-0","edanmdm-nmah_844281-1","edanmdm-nmah_844281-2","edanmdm-nmah_844281-3"],"date":{"label":1850,"era":"AD","source":"1850s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Manufacturing industries","Patents","Industrialization","Models (representations)","Transportation","Ocean","Invention and the Patent Model"],"geoLocation":[{"Other":{"type":"Place","content":"United States"}},{"Other":{"type":"Place","content":"New York"}},{"Other":{"type":"Place","content":"New York City"}},{"points":{"point":{"latitude":{"type":"decimal","content":"40.7"},"longitude":{"type":"decimal","content":"-74"}}}},{"points":{"point":{"latitude":{"type":"decimal","content":"43"},"longitude":{"type":"decimal","content":"-75"}}}}],"description":["Mechanical engineer Frederck Sickels devoted his career to improving steam engines and advancing their use at sea.

The coat has a short standing collar that fastens at the center front neck with one (1) metal hook-and-eye. The full-length fitted sleeves close at the slit cuffs with three (3) metal buttons each featuring the same design as the breast buttons on each cuff. A fabric loop is sewn at each outer shoulder and a metal loop at each inner shoulder for attaching the shoulder knots (b, c) to the coat. The tail of the coat has one deep slit at the center back. There are two (2) metal eagle buttons sewn one at either side of the center back waist at the top of the pleated tail. Two (2) additional buttons are sewn one at the bottom of each decorative side placket tucked under the pleat of each tail. The body and tails are lined with a black half-silk satin. The interior breasts, shoulders, and underarms are padded and quilted in parallel lines. An interior waist belt made from the broadcloth is sewn to the interior back and sides, but left loose in the front and fastens with one (1) large flat hook-and-eye at the center front. There is one (1) welted pocket at the interior proper left breast oriented vertically and one (1) welted pocket at the interior proper right breast oriented horizontally. There are two (2) inset tail pockets, one in the lining of each back side tail near the center back slit. All of the pockets are lined with black glazed cotton. The sleeves are fully lined with a cream cotton and silk striped fabric. A black fabric label is sewn at the interior center back neck with copper machine-embroidered text reading \"John G. Haas / Lancaster, Pa.\".","The shoulder knots (b, c) are both alike with a loop of doubled thick gilded metal cord at the top, a length of braid made from the metal cord, and an oval pillow faced in yellow wool broadcloth and trimmed in three rows of the metal cord. Centered in the pillow is a number \"9\" made from tightly coiled metal wire, indicating the soldier's regiment. Inside the open loop at the top of the braid is one (1) metal button featuring an eagle behind a shield with a \"C\" in it. The button is attached to a peg that runs through a hole to the underside of the shoulder knot and is attached to a metal hook. The hook fastens around the metal loop on the shoulders of the coat (a) and is part of a larger fastening mechanism that includes a long hinged clip, which slides through the fabric loops on the shoulders of the coat and then secures around the outer sides of the hook portion. The reverse of the shoulder knots are faced in navy blue wool broadcloth. The yellow wool ground beneath the braided cord and the underside of the oval are covering stiff paper.

Heinz of Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania, on February 4, 1879. Mr. Heinz’s patent was for a design to automate the sorting of vegetables (as well as fruits, pickles, etc.) by size. Commercial packing technology had improved significantly at the time of the patent, and to keep up with faster production timelines a more efficient sorting method not dependent on manual labor was needed. Mr. Heinz’s design is shown in the photo to the left. It consisted of a wooden frame that held two concentric cylinders mounted on a shaft that sloped downwards from right to left. The cylinders had longitudinal slots wide enough to allow items of that size to fall through. The machine would be operated by the crank shown at the left end. The crank turned the central shaft via a gear so that the cylinders revolved, distributing the items evenly within them. Near the left side of the photo the inner cylinder is visible where it exits from the larger, outer cylinder. A hopper, shown at the upper right of the machine, received the items to be sorted and introduced them into the inner cylinder. To reduce jamming and produce an even distribution of items, the hopper was vibrated by a ratchet and bar at the end of the shaft. The inner cylinder had slotted openings that were sized such that all but the largest items would fall through into the outer cylinder. The inner cylinder’s longitudinal slots ended where it exited from the outer cylinder because, at that point, only the largest items remained. They would travel down the closed inner cylinder to the collection bin at the left. The slots at the upper end of the outer cylinder were sized so that the smallest items to be sorted passed through and into a collection hopper shown at lower right. Medium sized items would travel down the outer cylinder to its left end where a plate would force them to fall into the middle collection hopper. Each collection hopper could be closed by slide-gates to hold the items until workers could empty them. While this patent model has provisions for just three grades of size, Mr. Heinz made note that his invention was not limited to any particular number. This patent improved upon an earlier one by Mr. Heinz which was Patent Number 197, 934, dated December 11, 1877. In a later patent (Number 212,849 dated March 4, 1879) Mr. Heinz and his brother and co-inventor, Henry J. Heinz (founder of the Heinz Company), provided further improvements in the sorter design. In that patent they limited their description to a design for sorting pickles. They did away with the concentric cylinders in favor of an inclined, vibrating box with exit slots of varying sizes to sort the pickles. In 1890 Mr. John H. Heinz again improved upon the designs with Patent Number 545,689, dated December 17, 1890. That design was for a more elaborate version of the concentric cylinder sorter.","The patent model is constructed of wood and metal. The model is complete and shows all the key elements of the patent with the exception of the collection hopper slide-gates which are missing. Diagrams showing the complete design can be found in the patent document online (www.USPTO.gov/patents/process/search/index.jsp)."],"isSensitive":false,"dateClean":1870},{"id":"edanmdm-nmaahc_2010.71.3","title":"Commemorative denim vest with buttons assembled by Joan Trumpauer Mulholland","unitCode":"NMAAHC","record_link":"https://nmaahc.si.edu/object/nmaahc_2010.71.3","museum":"National Museum of African American History and Culture","media":["edanmdm-nmaahc_2010.71.3-0"],"date":{"label":1960,"era":"AD","source":"1960s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Activism","Cvil Rights","Clothing and dress","Civil rights"],"geoLocation":false,"description":["A denim vest with twenty-three [23] pinback buttons pinned across the front.

It features a hinged writing board and a locking drawer for papers, pens, and inkwell.","By the summer of 1776 members of the Second Continental Congress prepared to declare their independence from Great Britain. They assigned the task of drafting the declaration to Thomas Jefferson, a delegate from Virginia. Jefferson would later write that rather than aiming for originality, \"it was intended to be an expression of the American mind.\" On July 4, 1776 the Continental Congress amended and adopted the declaration. Its words not only established the guiding principles for the new nation, it has served to inspire future generations in America and around the world.","The desk continued to be Jefferson's companion throughout his life as a revolutionary patriot, American diplomat, and president of the United States. While the drafts of the Declaration of Independence were among the first documents Jefferson penned on this desk, the note he attached under the writing board in 1825 was among the last: \"Politics as well as Religion has its superstitions. These, gaining strength with time, may, one day, give imaginary value to this relic, for its great association with the birth of the Great Charter of our Independence.\"","On November 14, 1825, Thomas Jefferson wrote to his granddaughter Eleanora Randolph Coolidge to inform her that he was sending his \"writing box\" as a wedding present. Jefferson's original gift of an inlaid desk had been lost at sea and his portable writing desk was intended as a replacement. The desk remained in the Coolidge family until April 1880, when the family donated it to the U.S. government.","In his letter, Jefferson wrote: \"Mr. Coolidge must do me the favor of accepting this [gift]. Its imaginary value will increase with years, and if he lives to my age, or another half-century, he may see it carried in the procession of our nation's birthday, as the relics of the Saints are in those of the Church.\""],"isSensitive":false,"dateClean":1770},{"id":"edanmdm-nmaahc_2014.146.1.1abc","title":"US Navy dress uniform hat worn by Admiral Michelle Howard","unitCode":"NMAAHC","record_link":"https://nmaahc.si.edu/object/nmaahc_2014.146.1.1abc","museum":"National Museum of African American History and Culture","media":["edanmdm-nmaahc_2014.146.1.1abc-0","edanmdm-nmaahc_2014.146.1.1abc-1","edanmdm-nmaahc_2014.146.1.1abc-2","edanmdm-nmaahc_2014.146.1.1abc-3","edanmdm-nmaahc_2014.146.1.1abc-4","edanmdm-nmaahc_2014.146.1.1abc-5","edanmdm-nmaahc_2014.146.1.1abc-6","edanmdm-nmaahc_2014.146.1.1abc-7","edanmdm-nmaahc_2014.146.1.1abc-8"],"date":{"label":1990,"era":"AD","source":"1990s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Women","Clothing and dress","Military"],"geoLocation":false,"description":["A US Navy dress uniform hat (a) worn by Admiral Michelle Howard as commander with a white waterproof fabric crown and a black canvas brim, with a hat band (b) featuring a US Navy insignia pin (c).

The interior of the hull is painted cream. At the interior of the stern is an enclosed white structure. A functioning door is attached at the center front of the enclosed structure, with carved slats and a small metal pin as a door knob. Two stained wooden circular pieces reach up out of the hull from the lower deck and extend above the removable upper deck (b) when it is in place. The rudder of the ship is functional. The exterior front of the bow has a decorative curled element with a carved outline detail. Above this is a stained wooden circular piece that protudes from the bow as a bowsprit. The lower deck has two rectangular cut-outs trimmed in cream raised edges. The one nearest the bow is larger than the one nearest the stern. They correspond to the rectangular openings on the removable deck (b). These cutouts are open to the hold. Lined along the lower deck are carved ivory figures painted or stained black. Each figure is an individually carved piece adhered to the ship, with individualized faces, bodies, and heights. Additional figures are visible in the hold from the rectangular openings. The figures are adult males and females, and some short figures may be meant to represent children or adolescents. All of the figures are wearing cloths around their genitals, but are bare-chested.","The removable deck (b) is made of a soft wood painted black on the top and left untreated on the bottom. The top of the deck has four cut-outs that are trimmed in cream painted wood. The first and third cut-outs from the bow are circular, the second is a rectangle with a raised cream edge, and the fourth is a rectangle with a box-like cream structure that is open on the back side but with a covered roof. In addition to the four larger cutouts there are two small square cut-outs in front of and flanking the circular cutout nearest the bow that are not trimmed in white detailing. There are three small holes, one at each side and one in front of the circular cut-out nearest the stern also not trimmed in white. There are two sets of two small holes at the edges of the deck flanking the cream roofed structure nearest the stern.","The stand (c) is made from wood and formed of two quatrefoil endcaps and a center dowel. There is decorative outline carving on the endcaps. The dowel is attached at a slight angle to accomodate the slope of the hull (a). The bottom of the hull sits parrallel to the dowel, resting on red wool pads that are adhered along the top edges of the endcaps. The wood is stained with a dark finish, of a different color than the black painted hull. The stand was clearly made for this ship model, but may not be original to it considering the different finish color."],"isSensitive":false,"dateClean":1890},{"id":"edanmdm-nasm_A19410007000","title":"Curtiss F9C-2 Sparrowhawk","unitCode":"NASM","record_link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv98703c81d-fd0c-4102-8180-6e3f5edb06e0","museum":"National Air and Space Museum","media":["edanmdm-nasm_A19410007000-0","edanmdm-nasm_A19410007000-1","edanmdm-nasm_A19410007000-2","edanmdm-nasm_A19410007000-3","edanmdm-nasm_A19410007000-4","edanmdm-nasm_A19410007000-5","edanmdm-nasm_A19410007000-6","edanmdm-nasm_A19410007000-7","edanmdm-nasm_A19410007000-8"],"date":{"label":1930,"era":"AD","source":"1930s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":false,"geoLocation":[{"L2":{"type":"Country","content":"United States of America"}}],"description":false,"dateClean":1930},{"id":"edanmdm-nmaahc_2016.48.43","title":"Samsonite hat box suitcase from Mae's Millinery Shop","unitCode":"NMAAHC","record_link":"https://nmaahc.si.edu/object/nmaahc_2016.48.43","museum":"National Museum of African American History and Culture","media":["edanmdm-nmaahc_2016.48.43-0","edanmdm-nmaahc_2016.48.43-1","edanmdm-nmaahc_2016.48.43-2","edanmdm-nmaahc_2016.48.43-3","edanmdm-nmaahc_2016.48.43-4","edanmdm-nmaahc_2016.48.43-5","edanmdm-nmaahc_2016.48.43-6","edanmdm-nmaahc_2016.48.43-7","edanmdm-nmaahc_2016.48.43-8"],"date":{"label":1940,"era":"AD","source":"1940s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Description and travel","Women","Business"],"geoLocation":[{"L5":{"type":"City","content":"Philadelphia"}},{"L3":{"type":"State","content":"Pennsylvania"}},{"L2":{"type":"Country","content":"United States"}},{"L1":{"type":"Continent","content":"North and Central America"}},{"L5":{"type":"City","content":"Hamilton"}},{"L2":{"type":"Country","content":"Bermuda"}},{"Other":{"type":"Subregion","content":"Caribbean"}},{"L1":{"type":"Continent","content":"North and Central America"}}],"description":["Light brown hard plastic Samsonite hat box suitcase with pale green synthetic fabric lining.

Earhart owned and wore this leather wool-lined flight suit manufactured by Arnold, Constable & Company, of Paris and New York. Such suits were essential for long-distance flights. Early airplanes offered scant protection from the elements, especially the icy cold at altitudes of 20,000 feet.","Born in Atchison, Kansas, Earhart fell in love with aviation at an early age. She was an excellent student and soloed in 1918 after only ten hours of instruction. In the early 1920s, she worked in a telephone office and photography studio to earn money for flying. In 1928 she became the first woman to cross the Atlantic by plane, accompanying pilot Wilmer Stultz in a Fokker tri-motor from Newfoundland to Wales. In 1931 she married publisher George Palmer Putnam. The following year she assured her place in history by becoming the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic. On May 21, 1932, she flew from Harbor Grace, Newfoundland, to a pasture near Londonderry, Ireland. The flight earned her worldwide acclaim and a number of awards, including the Distinguished Flying Cross and the French Legion of Honor.","In 1935 Earhart became the first woman to fly solo between Hawaii and the continental United States. Unlike Charles Lindbergh, Earhart was never a licensed airmail pilot. She did, however, carry mail. Her husband helped her raise funds for her flights by arranging for her to carry and autograph special letters that were sold to philatelists. The National Postal Museum owns her private collection.","After having set a speed record for flying non-stop from Mexico City to New York City in fourteen hours and nineteen minutes, Amelia Earhart tried to become the first female pilot to fly around the world. She took-off from Miami, Florida, on June 1, 1937, in her Electra aircraft, accompanied by Fred Noonan, her navigator. On July 2, while flying between Lae, New Guinea, and Howland Island in the Pacific Ocean, her plane vanished. The Coast Guard cutter Itasca, stationed near Howland Island, picked up intermittent signals from Earhart before she was lost. In one message, she reported that she was circling, unable to locate the island. Ships and radio hams reported receiving mysterious signals over the next two days, but none could be satisfactorily understood or identified. The search for the downed plane was the greatest air rescue attempt made to that date, using ten ships and 102 American planes. The search was fruitless. Neither Earhart nor her navigator was heard from again. Earhart’s fate continues to be a source of much speculation.","Arnold, Constable & Co., of Paris and New York had at least one other connection with a woman aviator. In October 1927 Ruth Elder carried a letter from the company’s New York store on a proposed transatlantic flight. The letter, addressed to “the manufacturers and couturiers of Europe and of America,” touted the company’s hundredth anniversary. Elder’s airplane was forced down in the ocean, where she and pilot George Haldeman were rescued by an oil tanker. Earhart did not carry a message from the company across the Atlantic on her successful flights, but she did wear an Arnold, Constable & Company-manufactured flight suit on at least one of them."],"isSensitive":false,"dateClean":1910},{"id":"edanmdm-nmaahc_2013.127.2.1ab-.2","title":"Robe and trunks worn by Denzel Washington as Rubin Carter in The Hurricane","unitCode":"NMAAHC","record_link":"https://nmaahc.si.edu/object/nmaahc_2013.127.2.1ab-.2","museum":"National Museum of African American History and Culture","media":["edanmdm-nmaahc_2013.127.2.1ab-.2-0","edanmdm-nmaahc_2013.127.2.1ab-.2-1","edanmdm-nmaahc_2013.127.2.1ab-.2-2","edanmdm-nmaahc_2013.127.2.1ab-.2-3","edanmdm-nmaahc_2013.127.2.1ab-.2-4","edanmdm-nmaahc_2013.127.2.1ab-.2-5","edanmdm-nmaahc_2013.127.2.1ab-.2-6","edanmdm-nmaahc_2013.127.2.1ab-.2-7","edanmdm-nmaahc_2013.127.2.1ab-.2-8","edanmdm-nmaahc_2013.127.2.1ab-.2-9","edanmdm-nmaahc_2013.127.2.1ab-.2-10","edanmdm-nmaahc_2013.127.2.1ab-.2-11","edanmdm-nmaahc_2013.127.2.1ab-.2-12","edanmdm-nmaahc_2013.127.2.1ab-.2-13","edanmdm-nmaahc_2013.127.2.1ab-.2-14","edanmdm-nmaahc_2013.127.2.1ab-.2-15"],"date":{"label":1990,"era":"AD","source":"1990s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Design","Actors and actresses","Costume","Clothing and dress","Hollywood (Film)","Athletes","Sports"],"geoLocation":[{"L2":{"type":"Country","content":"United States"}},{"L1":{"type":"Continent","content":"North and Central America"}}],"description":["A robe (.1ab) and a pair of boxing trunks (.2) worn by actor Denzel Washington as “Rubin ‘Hurricane’ Carter” in the 1999 biopic, “The Hurricane.”","The robe (.1a) is a long-sleeved, knee-length, hooded white terry cloth robe with a belt (.1b).

The costume consists of a silver skullcap (.1), a silver unitard (.2), a silver overbodice (.3), and silver boot covers (.4ab).","Skullcap, .1: The silver metallic skullcap is similar in style to an aviator's cap. It is made from two (2) layers of silver synthetic fiber that serve as the facing and the lining fabrics. The fabric is quilted in a series of parallel lines along the top of the cap from the forehead to the nape of the neck. The area covering the ears is not quilted and extends into two thinner strips, one on each side of the head, with rounded tops. The seams of the quilted sections are left exposed on the interior of the cap, but are finished with serge stitching.","Unitard, .2: The silver metallic unitard has full-length sleeves and ankle-length legs, with a collarless crew neck. It is made from a silver stretch synthetic fiber. The unitard closes at the center back with a metal zipper that reaches from the lower back to the neck. There are additional zippers at each ankle and wrist. It is fully lined with an off-white stretch synthetic fabric.","Overbodice, .3: Silver metallic overbodice garment worn over the bodysuit (.2). It is made from a silver metallic synthetic fiber used on the facing and the lining sides, quilted all over in parallel lines. The overbodice wraps around the wearer's chest and shoulders and secures with hook-and-eye fasteners in the front. When worn, the garment has a leaf-shaped front panel covering the stomach, wide shoulder wings that extend beyond the wearer's body, a v-shaped back panel that covers the spine, and a horizontal crescent-shaped panel that covers the wearer's buttocks. The bottom center of the crescent-shaped back panel is sewn to a wide band of elastic, attaching the back panel to the bottom tip of the leaf-shaped front stomach panel. The garment closes with metal hook-and-eye fasteners, one hook (1) at each side of the center front neck fastens to one (1) eye at the tip of the stomach panel, one (1) hook at each top outside edge of the back crescent-shaped panel wraps around to the front side and fastens to one (1) eye at each outside edge of the stomach panel. There is a thick metal rod, bent to form around the shoulder wing and keep it stiff, sewn inside the outermost quilted layer on the proper right side only; the proper left wing has no apparent interior support.","Leg covers, .4ab: Two lower leg covers, both alike, made from silver metallic synthetic fabric. The fabric is quilted in three (3) parallel lines that run from top to bottom down the center front, surrounded by a series of quilted parallel lines oriented at an angle. The covers are angled with a longer tip at the center front on the top and bottom edges. Both are lined with the silver facing fabric, and close at the center back of the leg with Velcro sewn at the left and right outer edges of the reverse. A length of elastic tape woven with silver metallic and white thread is sewn on the reverse exterior bottom edge of each cover, with a large metal hook at the loose end that attaches to a metal eye sewn on the reverse interior bottom edge."],"isSensitive":false,"dateClean":1970},{"id":"edanmdm-nmaahc_2011.59.48ab","title":"Electrical hot comb heater and hot comb","unitCode":"NMAAHC","record_link":"https://nmaahc.si.edu/object/nmaahc_2011.59.48ab","museum":"National Museum of African American History and Culture","media":["edanmdm-nmaahc_2011.59.48ab-0","edanmdm-nmaahc_2011.59.48ab-1","edanmdm-nmaahc_2011.59.48ab-2","edanmdm-nmaahc_2011.59.48ab-3","edanmdm-nmaahc_2011.59.48ab-4","edanmdm-nmaahc_2011.59.48ab-5","edanmdm-nmaahc_2011.59.48ab-6","edanmdm-nmaahc_2011.59.48ab-7","edanmdm-nmaahc_2011.59.48ab-8","edanmdm-nmaahc_2011.59.48ab-9","edanmdm-nmaahc_2011.59.48ab-10","edanmdm-nmaahc_2011.59.48ab-11","edanmdm-nmaahc_2011.59.48ab-12","edanmdm-nmaahc_2011.59.48ab-13","edanmdm-nmaahc_2011.59.48ab-14","edanmdm-nmaahc_2011.59.48ab-15","edanmdm-nmaahc_2011.59.48ab-16","edanmdm-nmaahc_2011.59.48ab-17","edanmdm-nmaahc_2011.59.48ab-18"],"date":{"label":1920,"era":"AD","source":"1920s"},"isExhibited":true,"topic":["Hair","Women"],"geoLocation":[{"L2":{"type":"Country","content":"United States"}},{"L1":{"type":"Continent","content":"North and Central America"}}],"description":["An electric hot comb heater with a hot comb.
