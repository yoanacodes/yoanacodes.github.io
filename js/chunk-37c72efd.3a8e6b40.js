Is there an overarching language pattern or does the context of the time period the speech was given in determine its language?</p><p>The project is focused on the ability to compare Presidents' speeches and visualizing which words they used the most. To achieve this, a rule was introduced that only words with five or more occurrences are displayed – this allows for an easier comparison as it removes a lot of noise.</p><p>The visualization allows users to draw insights not only about the words most used and potential topics discussed but also look at the evolution of language and how speeches become more wordy as time goes by. For example, while Washington’s word cloud barely contains 100 words fitting the criteria, Trump and Obama’s have hundreds of words. Further, some presidents, like Trump, consistently have specific words dominating their speech. In his case, comparing his speeches from 2017 and 2018 clearly shows that the words America, American, Americans dominate the rest of the language used.</p>",sections:{process:{design:{images:[{link:"assets/projects/sotu/project_image.png",description:"<p>With this project I wanted to explore the way State of the Union Speeches have changed throughout time, how current political and economical circumstances may affect them, and how language used by politicians has evolved.
