It proposes a novel way to visualize uncertainty, specifically in polling data. Uncertainty in polling data is often represented by statistical concepts such as margin of error, standard deviation or confidence intervals, which are not easily understood by people with little to no background in statistics. This project suggest using intuitive measures and language, such as minimum, maximum, and average, to make uncertainty data available to everyone.</p><p>The inspiration for the idea comes from error bars and density plots. These two visualization methods are used very often when representing uncertainty, however, the consepts behind them are not easy to grasp without having advanced understanding of statistics.
