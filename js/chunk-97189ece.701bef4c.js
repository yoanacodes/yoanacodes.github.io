Therefore, it is of great importance to analyze what we know historically about what makes certain groups more likely to subscribe to such believes and see if there are any strategies successfully employed in the past to unite people who are likely to be divided by such believes.

The data was collected by Open Psychometrics through a <a href='https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/GCBS/' target='_blank'>self-reported online survey</a> in 2016. The GCB scale includes 15 questions related to important facets of conspiracism, and respondents can answer them on a 5-point scale: from strongly disagree to strongly agree.
